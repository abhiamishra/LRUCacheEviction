# LRUCacheEviction
An implemented version of LRU Cache Eviction in Java with multiple abstract data structures

This is a self-implemented LRU Cache Eviction in Java using a doubly linked list as a queue implementation and hashmap. In essence, a LRU aims to remove the least recently used item from the cache to update the cache.

Currently: Implemented LRU Cache Eviction with primitive data types and data structures that work on those data types.
Goal: Expand to generic types + add a weightage system
Stretch Goal: Use the LRU Cache code to implement an interactive library system that tells user which books are performing the best and by what amount should the price increase by - in live time!
